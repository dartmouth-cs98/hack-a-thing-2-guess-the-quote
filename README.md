# hack-a-thing-2-guess-the-quote

Hello! and welcome to our hack a thing take 2. We worked together to pull from multiple APIs to fumble around a bit and better understand how to use them for our project. 
Our website pulls from 3 APIs, generating random quotes from Ron Swanson, Kanye West, and Donald Trump (although Google Chrome does not like the 3rd). We used the application Postman to help format our axios GET requests and assure we had to proper headers, etc. A random generated quote will appear on the site. Take a guess at who might have said it -- the real speaker's image will remain!
The second box on the website allows you to enter any word or string into the form and generate a robot based off of that string. This pulls from the Robohash Image Generator.
